				<h2>Hello! I'm Joshua Levine</h2>
				<p>I'm a software developer living in Tampa, FL.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Playing video games.</li>
					<li>Building Computers.</li>
					<li>Hanging out with my sisters dog.</li>
					<li>Watching movies and TV shows.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Please take some time to look at my website and if you would like <a href="#contact-me">contact me!</a></p>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I graduated from the Univernsity of Central Florida with a degree in Legal Studies. Afterwards I worked for an
					attorney doing family law for some time before attending law school. I attended law school for about a year
					and realized that, at this time, this was not the path that I wanted to take. After discussing it with my
					family and with some encouragement from my brother-in-law (who is a software engineer) I decided to pursue my
					love for computers by becoming one myself.
				</p>
				<p>Since then I have become a student at Thinkful and have loved every step of the journey so far!</p>
				<p>
					If you are looking for a new developer who is eager to learn as much as they can (or if you just want to talk
					about The Sopranos) please <a href="#contact-me">reach out!</a>
